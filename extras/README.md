# Extras

These classes and interfaces are not part of the official public Beast APIs,
but they are useful and used by tests and some third party programs.

Use them if you'd like, with the understanding that the interfaces may change.
You can put a copy of the implementations in your own source tree, or you can
just use these files by adding the extras/ directory to the list of includes
searched by your compiler.
